### :fire: NODERUNNING [ABOUT]

My main occupation is to maintain a large number of Nodes in working order—é. I've been doing it for about two years now, and I'm still doing it today.
<br>
My duties include:<br>
- Daily monitoring, I would even say hourly monitoring
- Keeping track of all current news and updates, and actively participating in all discussions
- Daily backup of all keys and other important files on each server
- Validation of especially promising projects and active participation in fixing all kinds of errors
<br> and so on.....<br><br>

### :fire: NODERUNNING [PORTFOLIO]

A list of nodes in which I participated, or am still participating:<br>
- :gem: SOLANA (This is the kind of project that can hook your heart and soul and enrich you. Unfortunately, such projects are very few and often you have to fight for them)
- MASSA (At the moment the 14th stage is already underway and the team obviously will not stop there)
- MASA FINANCE (Perhaps the most unpretentious project, which is simply pleasant to follow day after day)
- MINIMA (A unique project that allows you to use your phone to control the node)
- CELESTIA (A promising project, which I am sure will bring a lot of experience in the future)
- SUI (1 of 500 validators chosen from more than 28,000 participants)
- IRON FISH (A promising project with a funny name, and it is possible to mine coins directly on your home server)
- APTOS (A very interesting node with very serious requirements to become a validator)
- ZEITGEIST (An obscure project in which many people were disappointed)
- STARKNET (An interesting network with good prospects, but unfortunately recently declared unrewarding. But I continue to believe in the project out of personal conviction)
- SUBSPACE (This project will definitely please fans of stress tests and good rewards)
- HUMANODE (An intriguing project with its own launcher)
- ESPRESSO (It's still too early to talk about this node, but it's better to start getting into it as early as possible, because the developers' promises are very intriguing)
- GNOLAND
- BUNDLR

---------------- POST 02.12.2022 ----------------------------------
<br>
üëãIt's time for the first post. Yes, guys, that's right, it's time.

Anyway, in the last week, phase 2 of iron fish is over. Well, I was not very happy with the results, according to preliminary data there will be not many coins. But I am not discouraged, because it's time to support Aleo serious project. There are very big rewards waiting for all my colleagues and me, I believe that this project will change my life. That's basically all I wanted to say, at least that's all the current information for the last couple of weeks for sure.

Now a little bit about my life.
I got an offline job so that I have money to pay for all the servers, for there are already more than 20 of them. Yeah, I'm in shock myself about it, but it's been happening gradually, so my psyche is still intact). Also, I started seeing a psychologist, because it is very difficult to bear all the emotional burden alone, it is just too difficult.
And now it's time to say goodbye - until we meet again!

---------------- POST 11.12.2022 ----------------------------------
<br>
Today's post is all about purpose and the problem of the difficulty of achieving goals, even the most important ones.

In general we are all human and we all like to plan something, especially before the weekend we set grand plans for the next week, and at the end of the year we swear to ourselves that we will be successful next year. But in the end all the promises and goals are broken and successfully postponed, and in their place comes a whole bunch of clever excuses and a million reasons. Then it all turns into a huge snowball, I would even say a colossal snowball. And the lucky one is the one whose heart melts it very quickly. But often this is not the case, and this unfortunate lump gradually cools the ardor and heat.

How to avoid it? How to stop procrastinating? After all, even willpower does not help, because it is extremely difficult and sometimes unreal to deceive your brain or force it to overstretch.

This is how this post turned out. I hope this will lead you to certain thoughts and I myself will try to find the answer to all these questions in a week. See you later!
